# ELEVATEX-personalized AI-driven upskilling plans
This repository contains a project submitted as part of our participation in the work environment Hackathon by lablab.mena

##Introduction
In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, organizations strive to optimize their workforce's potential and maintain a competitive edge. Recognizing the importance of employee development and upskilling, this project aims to leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create personalized upskilling plans based on employee performance and current skill levels.
This data-driven approach enables the identification of patterns, strengths, and areas for improvement, laying the foundation for a robust employee development framework.

## Problem
Employees with years of experience are often assigned to projects that require specialized skills and knowledge. However, employees may not have the time or resources to pursue the necessary training on their own. Assigning courses to employees and tracking their progress manually can be time-consuming and resource-intensive for managers.

## Sulotion
To address the challenge, we explored creating a personalized learning App powered by AI. This app would provide tailored recommendations and guidance to employees, helping them improve their skills and advance in their careers.

This project harnesses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to tailor upskilling plans for employees, leveraging their performance and existing skill sets. By analyzing data, it identifies strengths and areas for improvement, forming a strong foundation for a comprehensive employee development program in today's dynamic business environment.

Experienced employees often face the challenge of acquiring specialized skills for project assignments, hindered by limited time and resources. Manual course assignments and progress tracking for managers become resource-intensive.

To tackle this issue, we envisioned an AI-powered personalized learning app. This innovative tool tailors recommendations and guidance for employees, enabling skill enhancement and career advancement.

## Project Features:

Scalable Solution: Our AI-driven app accommodates diverse job roles and experience levels, making it adaptable for organizations of any size.
Customized Recommendations: The app generates individualized learning paths, suggesting courses and training programs aligned with an employee's experience.
Time and Cost Efficiency: Streamlining the learning process enhances productivity and cost-effective skill development.
Continuous Improvement: The app's recommendations adapt to industry trends, ensuring employees access the most relevant learning resources.

##In the future, our program aims to:

-Create individualized learning paths based on the analyzed data of the registered employees in Saudi Arabia.

-Provide real-time feedback and support by tracking their progress, and helping them to stay on track in career growth aspect.

-Support businesses with insights that empower them to develop a training program for the workforce to meet their business needs. And be a part of the contribution to the economic growth of Saudi Arabia

-We are excited to continue developing our program and to work with the Hadaf Human Resources Development Fund to make it a reality for all employees in Saudi Arabia.
